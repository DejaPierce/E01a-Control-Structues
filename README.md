In this assignment I went over the steps of trying create a program that will be able to print out a certain color, or a program that will let me playing a game of guess what the color is and it will record how many times it took to get the answer right. I also found out new lines of coding and ways to avoid a syntax error. Another thing that I did was try to make changes to certain files to see how the change that I made could affect the program. These changes will help me know what things I should avoid when I program on my own. The last thing that I did for this assignment was that I tried to describe what each line of code meant for extra credit. Althought it was difficult it helped me better my understanding of what each line of coding does in a program. 

I couldn't find the message textbox: The changes I made were to: LICENSE, main 5.py, main8.py, main10.py questions.txt, and README.md.
